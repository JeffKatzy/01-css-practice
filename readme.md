## Objectives

Become more familiar with HTML and CSS selectors.

## Your task
Open up the index.html file.  You will see that we have added some css styles there for you.  Your task is to create some HTML elements.  Do the following.

A. First a  add some HTML
1.  Create a header that welcomes the user to a new education site.
2.  Create a div and place the rest of the content inside of the div.
3.  Inside the div, add a paragraph that asks, "What do you want to learn?  Here are the steps..."
4.  Under the paragraph, create a list, with the list items for learning something new.
5.  Then create a link (an anchor) to Google with the text saying, "Or Just Google!".

B. Now let's add some styling to the page.
1. Add the .button class to your link.  You'll know it's working if your link looks like a button.
2. The font looks rather ugly.  There is a style to change the text to a "sans-serif".  Change the text for everything in the div to have a font of "sans-serif"
3. We would like to turn our list into a menu of steps.  Find the class related to menu and list, and add the corresponding classes.
4. Now let's try to make the menu horizontal.  Take a look at the styles and see what classes you can to the list and list items.
